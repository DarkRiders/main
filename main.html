		<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. 
			Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new 
			civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.

			The path of a cosmonaut is not an easy, triumphant march to glory. You have to get to know 
			the meaning not just of joy but also of grief, before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin.

			For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more 
			who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in 
			our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.

			We have an infinite amount to learn both from nature and from each other

			NASA is not about the ‘Adventure of Human Space Exploration’…We won’t be doing it just to get 
			out there in space – we’ll be doing it because the things we learn out there will be making life 
			better for a lot of people who won’t be able to go.

			Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.

			Problems look mighty small from 150 miles up.
